# PyTorch PPF-FoldNet
This repo is implementation for PPF-FoldNet(https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10322v1) in pytorch. 

## Milestone
- 3.25: Initial Version
    - Realize the network architecuture of PPF-FoldNet 
    - The input is still the point coordinates for now. And the dataset used is ShapeNet. 
    



## TODO List
- [ ] dataset & dataloader for 3DMatch Dataset.
- [ ] Input Preparation. (Point coordinates -> point pair feature)
- [ ] Evaluation. (Recall on 3DMatch Dataset)
