        a (2D tensor): The left-hand side, shaped (B1, F).
        b (2D tensor): The right-hand side, shaped (B2, F).
        metric (string): Which distance metric to use, see notes.

    Returns:

    Note:
        When a square root is taken (such as in the Euclidean case), a small
        epsilon is added because the gradient of the square-root at zero is
        undefined. Thus, it will never return exact zero in these cases.
